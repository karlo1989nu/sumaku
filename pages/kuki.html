                        <p>
                            My mom is BoGi, she is a Catniplord and she owns a dark-web-catnip shop. She had 4 children
                            but Neko, my brother, passed away when he was just a baby. This situation made my momchange
                            the
                            way she saw life and
                            she started to enjoy more time with us. I still hate when she wants to
                            tongue-bath us but she forces us because that reminds her of when we were less than a
                            month old. She also own 2 hoomans that work very hard to give us everything, I hope they
                            continue like that because, otherwise, she would have to replace them. They have been with
                            mom
                            for more than 4 years now and sometimes she miss them when they are out for work because she
                            says it's only because she
                            likes the way they clean our sandbox.

                                My sister always says that we aren't her real family, because she was born in a
                                trillionaire
                                family, not in our poor family. She says she deserves the best water in the world and
                                that it's very exhausting to
                                always try to teach our 2 slaves how to correctly comb her hair without success. She
                                says
                                that someday her real family will find her and will take her to their beautiful place
                                where
                                she will have many slaves at her disposition and who would always bring her water every
                                time
                                she asks them. She says she is sick and tired of our 2 slaves because they never
                                work for her, and recently they have installed a bucket to collect water and they
                                pretend
                                that she auto serves herself. I love my syster, she is the best!

                                My brother Mao was born to rock! Everybody loves him because he is very cute, mommy
                                always says that he is a
                                handsome cat and he is the only one who can make our hoomans wake up at 2 am in the
                                morning. We don't understand why mommy lets them sleep for so many hours, but Mao always
                                tell
                                her it makes them so useless, and then he goes to wake them up every morning at
                                the same exact time, 2 am. He is always searching for new adventures, and I always find
                                new
                                places to hide and scare my slaves because they know that if I disappear, mommy would
                                ask one of her guys to take them out.

                                I love my family and my 2 slaves, they are always there for me when I want them to rub
                                my belly. Sometimes the female hooman plays music because, in a very strange way, she
                                was able to understand my singing once and, of course, she liked my Catenor voice. That
                                day I was very surprised that a hooman was able to appreciate Cat opera. She is pretty
                                nice to play music for me to sing and I do enjoy it a lot when I sing for them because
                                it gives me a feeling that I am doing something good for this inferior race. Who
                                wouldn't say that if cats didn't exist, they would become a smart species and takeover
                                the world?
